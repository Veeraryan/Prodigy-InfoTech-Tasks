Wow, I had this amazing chance, you know, to really learn the fundamentals of cryptography by creating a Caesar Cipher application. (The Caesar Cipher is one kind of substitution cipher that encrypts & decrypts communications by shifting the alphabet by a fixed number - the shift value.) This project, it really improved my programming skills & expanded my knowledge of traditional encryption techniques.

I had to use Python to design the algorithms for this software, to make sure the encryption & decryption procedures worked well & were intuitive for the user. And I gained knowledge about the value of secure data transmission, as well as the historical significance of cryptographic techniques.
