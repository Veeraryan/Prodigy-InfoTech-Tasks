I had the amazing chance to learn the fundamentals of cryptography by creating a Caesar Cipher application. One kind of substitution cipher is the Caesar Cipher, which encrypts and decrypts communications by shifting the alphabetic characters by a fixed number(shift value).
This project improved my programming abilities and expanded my knowledge of traditional encryption techniques.
I had to use Python to design the algorithms for this software in order to make sure that the encryption and decryption procedures worked well and were intuitive for the user.
I gained knowledge about the value of data transmission security as well as the historical significance of cryptographic techniques.
