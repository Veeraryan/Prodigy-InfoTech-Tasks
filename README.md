I had the amazing chance to learn the fundamentals of cryptography by creating a Caesar Cipher application. One kind of substitution cipher is the Caesar Cipher, which encrypts and decrypts communications by shifting the alphabetic characters by a fixed number(shift value). This project improved my programming abilities and expanded my knowledge of traditional encryption techniques.
